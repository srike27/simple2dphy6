# simple2dphy6
Me trying to learn to use pygame by making a simple 2d physics model
<br>
To run execute run the ballimpulsev1.py file
<br>
ball can be maneuvered around using  UP,DOWN,RIGHT,LEFT buttons
<br>
The pptopt.py file illustrates a cascaded p controller for controlling position wrt to itself and vref wrt to position.
